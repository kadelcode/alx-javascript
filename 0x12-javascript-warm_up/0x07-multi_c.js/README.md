Write a script that prints ```x``` times "C is fun"
- Where ```x``` is the first argument of the script
- If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”
- You must use ```console.log(...)``` to print all output
- You are not allowed to use ```var```
- You can use only two ```console.log```
- You must use a loop (```while```, ```for```, etc.)
